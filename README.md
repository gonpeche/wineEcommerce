# Pr√≥xima Copa (Next Cup)
## Wine E-commerce

Final project of the coding bootcamp which aimed to integrate all the technologies and best practices learned during bootcamp experience.

The project was formed by 4 devs and 1 scrum master. The whole project was built from back to front, using different technologies and working closely with each team member, reviewing every pull request and doing pair programming if needed. The webapp was built as SPA (single page application) using **React-Router**.

On the backend, we used **Node.js** with **Express.jss**, also **PostgreSQL** was chosen with **Sequelize** as the ORM por data persistence. Also **Passport** was integrated for user authentication.

On the fronend, we worked with **React**, **Redux** (react-redux), **Babel** (compiler), **Material-UI** and **Webpack** for bundling the project.

The whole project duration was 6 weeks.
